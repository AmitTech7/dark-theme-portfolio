# Live Projects Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots for the Live Projects page.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Save your project screenshots in this folder with the following names:
   - `linkedin-architect.png` - LinkedIn Professional Architect screenshot
   - `etf-shop.png` - ETF Shop India screenshot
   - `finance-tracker.png` - Finance Tracker screenshot
   - `market-pulse.png` - MarketPulse India screenshot

2. Make sure the images are in PNG or JPG format
3. Recommended image size: 1920x1080 or 1280x720 for best quality
4. The images will be automatically displayed on the Live Projects page

## Screenshot Tips

- Capture the main dashboard or landing page of each project
- Use high-quality screenshots (no blur or pixelation)
- Consider using browser extension tools like "Full Page Screen Capture" for complete page screenshots
- If needed, you can also use placeholder images from services like:
  - https://picsum.photos/
  - https://placehold.co/
  - https://via.placeholder.com/

## Example

If you want to use a placeholder for now:
```
linkedin-architect.png -> Replace with your actual screenshot
```

The current setup uses fallback gradients if images fail to load, so the page will still look good even without screenshots initially.
